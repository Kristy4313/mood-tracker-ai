# Mood Tracker 🧠💬

A simple mood tracker that lets users log daily emotions and journal entries.  
This project will later include Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze journal sentiment and emotional trends over time.

## 🔍 Features

✅ Log your mood each day  
✅ Save moods and timestamps to a file  
✅ View your mood history  
🚧 Coming soon: sentiment analysis and visual trends

## 🧠 Goals

- Practice Python for real-world projects
- Build a foundation for AI/NLP features
- Learn how to structure, document, and track progress in a GitHub repo

## 📁 Project Structure

mood-tracker/
├── main.py # Core console program
├── mood_data.csv # Logs moods and timestamps
├── README.md # This file
└── requirements.txt # For dependencies (to be added later)


## 📦 Requirements

For now, just Python 3.

Later:
- `textblob` or `vaderSentiment` for NLP
- `matplotlib` for charts (optional)

Install packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## ✅ What to do next:
1. Replace `[Your Name]` with your name or GitHub username  
2. Add it to your repo as `README.md`  
3. Commit and push:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add professional README"
git push
